spotify_scrapper
================
I wanted an automated way to capture data from a spotify playlist. This script assumes that a list has been created in a text file from a spotify playlist. You can copy all the songs in a spotify playlist and then paste it into a text file. Then replace all the spaces in that file with line returns and save the file. Pass that into this script. 

The goal 

run like this:
ruby test.rb <file>

TODO:
 * Create a standard playlist file automatically from this data
 * Use google music api to automatically find the songs and add them to a google music playlist
